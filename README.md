# Optical Character Recognition Based On Minimum Distance Classifier

This repository contains code for a problem related to Minimum Distance Classifier(MDC) in pattern recognition. The problem involves generating prototypes and classify optical character for recognition goal.

## Course Information

This problem is related to a *Statistical Pattern Recognition* course taught by Professor Mohammad Rahmati (<rahmati@aut.ac.ir>) in the Computer Engineering department at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Tehran, Iran. The course was offered in the Fall of 2021.

## Problem Description

The problem involves use given dataset, which contains 3 sets. The goal is to generate prototypes for each class of optical character for classification purposes.

The problem is divided into three parts. Each part has different optical characters.
